# Research Tools

Research tools for educational quantitative research "Project Cauldrons".

Created for easier research, this repositary is built mainly using multiprocessing for parallel computering & pandas.
As much as possible, I would prefer to use the 2 modules to ensure consistancy as well as taking it as an opportunity to improve my Python knowledge.

Please make sure you go through the algorithm before using it, let me know if you found error anywhere.

This repo is purely for educational purpose, good for quantitative concept reinforcement and hands-on experience.

Please ensure you have the below modules installed in conda enviroment or pip:

* Python 3.7.4
* numpy 1.17.3
* numba 0.49.1
* pandas 1.0.3

No documentation is provided as of this point in time, so you have to look for what you are interested in.

Most of the logic can be found in Advance in Financial Machine Learning.

The textbook itself is meant for graduate studies writtern by Dr Macros Lopez De Prado.

I will highly recommend you to purchase this book to bridge the knowledge gap.

The mathematics behind most of what was taught are actually realistic and practical (White box).
Every procedure that was taught in the book is specific at address common issues in Financial Machine-learning applications.

1. Either to improve statistic properties
2. Improve Machine-Learning results

Most of the code snippets written in the book was done using Python 2 & Pandas below stable release.

I rewrote or modified the codes so that it will be compatible in Pandas 1.0.3 & Python 3.

The code base is still messy since it is still under development stage.

* Standard Data Bars
* Imbalance Bars
* Meta-Labels
* Fractional Differentiate
* Sequential bootstrapping
